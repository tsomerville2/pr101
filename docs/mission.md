# Mission - Lawn Care Timing Calculator

## Vision
The Lawn Care Timing Calculator provides homeowners and lawn care professionals with scientifically-based optimal timing recommendations for essential lawn care activities. By accounting for regional climate differences and seasonal patterns, the system eliminates guesswork and maximizes the effectiveness of lawn care investments. The calculator serves as a reliable decision-support tool that considers temperature requirements, seasonal timing, and geographic climate variations to ensure lawn care activities are performed when they will be most beneficial for grass health and growth.

## Success Criteria
1. **Accurate Regional Timing**: Provide timing recommendations that account for 2-4 week variations between Northern, Central, and Southern climate zones
2. **Temperature Validation**: Ensure all recommendations include optimal temperature ranges and validate current conditions
3. **Complete Activity Coverage**: Support all 8 essential lawn care activities with specific timing guidance
4. **Next Window Calculation**: Always provide the next optimal timing window when current conditions are not suitable

## In Scope
- 8 core lawn care activities (Seeding, Fertilizing, Dethatching, Aeration, Overseeding, Weed Control, Grub Control, Winterizing)
- 3 regional climate zones with specific timing adjustments
- Temperature range validation for optimal conditions
- Monthly scheduling and yearly calendar generation
- Command-line interface for easy access
- Next optimal window calculations

## Out of Scope
- Specific grass type recommendations (focuses on general timing)
- Weather prediction or forecast integration
- Soil condition analysis beyond temperature
- Pest identification or disease diagnosis
- Equipment recommendations or purchasing guidance
- Integration with calendar applications

## App Name Rationale
**Chosen Name**: Lawn Care Timing Calculator
**Reasoning**: The name clearly communicates the primary function (calculating timing) and domain (lawn care). It's descriptive enough for immediate understanding while remaining concise and professional. The word "timing" emphasizes the precision and scheduling focus, while "calculator" indicates the computational nature and reliability of the recommendations.
